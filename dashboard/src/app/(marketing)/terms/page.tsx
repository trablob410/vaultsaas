        <li>Encrypted storage of API keys, credentials, and other secrets.</li>
        <li>
          Human-in-the-loop approval workflows so operators can review and authorise secret
          access requests made by AI agents via the MCP protocol.
        </li>
        <li>Audit logging, dynamic secrets, and role-based access control.</li>

      {/* 2 */}
      <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
      <p>
        You must register for an account to use the Service. You agree to provide accurate,
        current, and complete information and to keep that information up to date. You are
        responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for all activity
        that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:hello@valt.turbo.ai.vn">hello@valt.turbo.ai.vn</a> if you suspect
        unauthorised access.
      </p>

      {/* 3 */}
      <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree <strong>not</strong> to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service to store credentials that facilitate illegal activity.</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, probe, or exploit the Service infrastructure.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Resell or sublicense the Service without our prior written consent.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      {/* 4 */}
      <h2>4. Data Handling and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Secret values are encrypted client-side before transmission using AES-256-GCM envelope
        encryption. The Company does not have access to plaintext secret values (&quot;zero-knowledge
        architecture&quot;). Metadata (secret names, tags, access logs) is stored in our
        database and is visible to the Company for operational purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we implement industry-standard security measures, no system is perfectly secure.
        You are responsible for the sensitivity and classification of data you store in the
        Service.
      </p>

      {/* 5 */}
      <h2>5. Billing and Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Paid plans are billed on a subscription basis (monthly or annually) through Stripe, our
        third-party payment processor. By subscribing you authorise Stripe to charge your
        payment method on a recurring basis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time from the
          billing settings. Access continues until the end of the current billing period; no
          partial refunds are issued.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Price changes:</strong> We will provide at least 30 days&apos; notice before
          increasing subscription prices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Taxes:</strong> Prices are exclusive of applicable taxes, which are your
          responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Free tier:</strong> We may offer a free tier with usage limits. Limits are
          subject to change with reasonable notice.
        </li>
      </ul>
